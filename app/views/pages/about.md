# About Rails Stats

Ever wondered about the size and scope of different Rails applications? Whether you're curious about successful indie products or established platforms, Rails Stats lets you look under the hood of real-world Rails businesses.

Rails Stats shows you the actual numbers behind [small](https://railsstats.com/projects/spinal-builder) and [large](https://railsstats.com/projects/basecamp) (the OG) Rails applications. See the lines of code in controllers, helpers, JavaScript, and StyleSheets. It's perfect for benchmarking your project or finding inspiration in how small (in LoC) some financial successful project are.

Adding yours is straightforward: just run `bin/rails stats` in your Rails app and share the results. Each submission helps build a better picture of how Rails applications are built in the real world.

Rails Stats is still in its early stage (launched 2025-01-01), there are plans to add features like historical comparisons and the ability to sort projects by size. Right now, the focus is on gathering stats from companies willing to share their numbers.

The project is [open source](https://github.com/rails-designer/railsstats.com), so you can help improve it, add features, or fix bugs. Every contribution helps make Rails Stats more useful for the community. Thanks in advance. ❤️
